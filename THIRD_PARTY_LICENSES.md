Bandal's design was informed by a study of the Orca codebase
(analysis notes: `docs/orca-analysis.md`, clone reviewed at
v1.4.169-rc.0). The following Bandal modules follow Orca **patterns and
parameters** — each was re-implemented from scratch in this repository;
**no verbatim Orca code was copied**:

| Bandal file | Orca inspiration |
|---|---|
| `src/main/features/agent/claude/modelProbe.ts` | `src/shared/claude-model-list-probe.ts` — `list_models` control_request probe with static fallback (re-implemented against the verified CLI 2.1.222 wire format) |
| `src/main/features/agent/eventBatcher.ts` | `src/main/ipc/native-chat.ts` — 40ms debounce / 250ms max-wait batching parameters |
| `src/main/features/browser/webviewPolicy.ts`, `hardenWebviews.ts` | hardened-`<webview>` recipe (fail-closed `will-attach-webview`, `will-navigate` + `will-redirect` guards, `setWindowOpenHandler` forwarding) |
| `src/renderer/src/stores/workspaceStore.ts`, `features/workspace/layoutPersistence.ts` | explicit ordered hydration + structural-diff save subscriber (no zustand persist) |
| `src/renderer/src/features/pdf/lib/scrollMemory.ts` | `PdfViewer.tsx` scroll-position LRU cache idea |
| `src/renderer/src/features/workspace/NewTabMenu.tsx` | typed "+"-omnibox tab-create menu concept |
| `src/renderer/src/features/onboarding/**` (wizard versioning, live preflight probes, dismissible preflight cards) | `use-onboarding-flow.ts`, `setup-guide/use-setup-guide-progress.ts`, `Landing.tsx` + `landing-preflight-issues.ts` |
| `docs/STYLEGUIDE.md` | `docs/STYLEGUIDE.md` document structure (role/anti-role token tables) |

Because these are independent re-implementations of ideas and
parameters, the MIT notice below is included for transparency and as a
good-faith attribution rather than as a strict license obligation. If
any Orca code is ever ported verbatim in the future, this notice (or a
file header) MUST be kept alongside it.
