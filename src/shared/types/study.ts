/**
 * Course activity log + the AI study tools built on top of it.
 *
 * Why an activity log exists at all: the agent runs with the course folder as
 * its cwd and blanket Read/Glob/Grep, so it can already see *files*. What it
 * could never see is what the student actually DID — which slide they
 * highlighted, which task they finished, what they asked last week. All of
 * that lived in SQLite, invisible. These events are the missing half, and they
 * are surfaced to the agent as a generated dossier under `.bandal/` inside the
 * course folder (dotfiles are skipped by the materials indexer and watcher, so
 * it stays invisible in the UI while remaining trivially readable by the CLI).
