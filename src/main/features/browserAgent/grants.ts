/**
 * What the agent is allowed to do, and where.

 * `improvement-backlog.md` §5.8 is right about the existing tool-permission
 * grant: it is a bare tool name, applied course-wide, forever, with the event
 * suppressed so the student never learns it happened, and with no way to list
 * or revoke it. This deliberately inherits none of that.
 *
 * A grant is a TUPLE — (course, exact origin, capability) — and it expires.
 * There is no "forever" and no wildcard: a permission the student cannot
 * picture is a permission they cannot withdraw.

 *  - `actionPolicy.ts` refuses submit controls and password fields
 *    structurally, before any grant is consulted
 *  - 수강신청·결제 origins are refused categorically and never asked about

 * So the grant means "look at this site and move around in it". Writing to it
