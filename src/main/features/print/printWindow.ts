/**
 * Printing the bytes the student just looked at.
 *
 * The obvious implementation — call `webContents.print()` on the guest — is
 * wrong twice over:
 *
 *  1. **It prints something else.** `printToPDF` (Chromium's
 *     `Page.printToPDF`) and the platform print job are different pipelines
 *     that disagree on pagination and scaling, so the paper would not match
 *     the preview. Printing the previewed PDF is byte-exact by construction.
 *  2. **It re-enters the "only works once" family** (electron#21195, #14705,
 *     #16219) — every one of those is about repeated prints on the SAME
 *     WebContents. A window created per job and destroyed afterwards can
 *     never reach a second call.
 *
 * Two things about the window matter. It must be VISIBLE before `print()`:
 * on macOS the print panel is a sheet on the owning NSWindow, and a sheet on
 * a hidden window is an invisible dialog with a hung-looking app. And it needs
 * `plugins: true`, or it has no PDF viewer to print from.
